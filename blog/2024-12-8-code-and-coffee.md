### A Welcoming and Diverse Community

The event provided a very welcoming atmosphere, with people from various backgrounds. It was incredible to meet people who have great experience in programming, each with their preferred languages, even COBAL. One person humorously shared that they hate COBOL but mentioned that we could still make a good living if we wish to get into it early though we'd probably hate every minute of it (laughs)
I met people working in different areas of tech, such as full-stack web development, machine learning, and Android development. What was great about them was the enthusiasm they had for their work. Each person spoke passionately about their current projects. It was inspiring to hear how deeply these individuals care about their work and how it motivates them.


### Sharing My Journey as a CS Graduate Student

As we went around introducing ourselves, I had the opportunity to share my background as a Computer Science graduate student involved in the open-source initiative at SLU. I talked about how we build and deliver open-source software to solve real-world problems. It felt great to represent a cause that’s so impactful and aligned with the values of the group

### Creativity in Tech

One of the most interesting conversations was with a person who has seven years of industry experience but comes from an art background. He shared how tech is a medium for expressing creativity, much like art. It’s not about mastering a specific language or framework. It’s about solving problems that require creative thinking. He spoke about the satisfaction that comes when everything falls into place, like completing a piece of art.

### Invaluable Encouragement

Everyone at the event was incredibly encouraging. Many people we spoke with appreciated the value-driven development that we’re involved in, especially since we’re working on open-source projects. As we shared our experiences and showed them our work, we felt happy to receive such positive feedback. It was helpful to receive advice and feedback from people in tech.
