### A Welcoming and Diverse Community



### Sharing My Journey as a CS Graduate Student

As we went around introducing ourselves, I had the opportunity to share my background as a Computer Science graduate student involved in the open-source initiative at SLU. I talked about how we build and deliver open-source software to solve real-world problems. It felt great to represent a cause that’s so impactful and aligned with the values of the group

### Creativity in Tech

One of the most interesting conversations was with a person who has seven years of industry experience but comes from an art background. He shared how tech is a medium for expressing creativity, much like art. It’s not about mastering a specific language or framework. It’s about solving problems that require creative thinking. He spoke about the satisfaction that comes when everything falls into place, like completing a piece of art.
