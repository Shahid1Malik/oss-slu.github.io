Strange Loop is an annual technology conference that gathers innovators, 
researchers, and professionals from diverse fields to explore and discuss emerging 
trends, cutting-edge technologies, and unconventional ideas. The conference held 
in St. Louis, Missouri, featured a wide range of topics, including programming 
languages, web development, artificial intelligence, distributed systems, and more.

Abhilash Kotha and Sailikhita Pulijala, second-year Master's students in Computer Science and Research Assistants with Open Source with SLU along with a few other students from the department had an opportunity to attend the event as volunteers. They not only contributed to the success of the event but also gained valuable experience in the process.  The two-day conference was full of opportunities for students. A few students were at the [Lemniscate sculpture](https://dgtized.github.io/lemniscate/) created by  [Ann Johnson](https://annjohnson.art/) and [Charles L.G. Comstock](https://github.com/dgtized) explaining the participants about the sculpture and answering any questions they had. The volunteers also assisted the organizers in distributing the merchandise and facilitating the book signing event on the second day of the event. They were able to connect with representatives from SafeStack, Strava, Swimm, Vonage, Improving, Capital One, Flexiana, John Deere and many other companies about their newest inventions and products.
