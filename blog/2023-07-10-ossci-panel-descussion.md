It was an inspiring conversation about accelerating scientific discovery through open-source science. Panelists Tim Holy, Alexy Khrabrov, Patrick Cuba, Abhilash Kotha, and Raju Karmuri had engaging discussions that shed light on many important topics the audience liked their conversation on how to bridge the communication gap between science and technical communities with more education and training, and how open source could help that.
