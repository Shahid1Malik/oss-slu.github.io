# OSS across SLU

## About the project

We are a team from the Open Source with SLU dedicated to promoting, improving, and sustaining open-source practices across our campus. This initiative of ours aims to identify all open-source projects and projects with the potential to become open source within the university. By doing so, we strive to support project teams in enhancing their work, preparing for external contributions, and ensuring long-term sustainability.

## Our Mission
Our primary goal is to:

1. **Identify and Catalog Projects**: Create a comprehensive inventory of open-source projects or those that can potentially transition to open source.
2. **Evaluate Project Readiness**: Assess the current state of these projects and their readiness for external contributions.
3. **Support and Enhance**: Offer guidance and resources to:
   - Improve code quality, documentation, and accessibility.
   - Prepare projects for external contributors.
   - Implement best practices for sustainable development.
4. **Promote Open Source Culture**: Foster a culture of collaboration, transparency, and innovation across the university.
