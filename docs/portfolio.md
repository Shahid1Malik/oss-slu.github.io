# Portfolio

Open Source with SLU makes open source software that supports research.

## New Projects, Partnerships, & Products

We are open to new project requests. Learn more on our [software request page](about/software).
We are especially interested in projects supporting researchers, focused on research outcomes, meeting unmet needs.

## Current Open Source with SLU Products

<!-- **Project Name** One-sentence description of the purpose of the project  -->

**[DADS (Database of Arithmetic Dynamical Systems)](project_dads/about.md)** - DADS is a flexible, web-based, search-driven user interface for a database of information about a class of mathematical functions known as "arithmetic dynamical systems".
  
**[Digital Bone Box](project_digital_bone_box/about.md)** - DBB is a web application for displaying and editing sets of annotated anatomical images. The project started with an a set of annotated human bones.

**[Drone World](project_droneworld/about.md)** - Drone World is a platform for testing small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) applications by simulating realistic test scenarios based on specified requirements.

**[Electronic Structure Parser](./project_esp/about.md)** - ESP is a web application that allows the user to upload the ORCA/Gaussian data, and quickly extract relevant tabular results in a Word document.

**[Enhancing Bioinformatics Research through LLM](project_enhancing_bioinformatics_research_through_LLM/about.md)** - This project is focused on developing an AI-driven tool that supports bioinformatics research by providing intelligent API recommendations, detecting errors, and offering real-time corrections. The tool leverages large language models trained on bioinformatics codebases to ensure reliable data retrieval and analysis, ultimately improving research accuracy and efficiency.

**[Image Recognition Integration System](project_iris)** - IRIS is a framework for creating custom mobile applications that can handle specialized image search problems. The framework was developed to create an application that uses a custom AI model to identify details about orthopedic screws from x-ray images of a patient. 
  
**[MeltShiny](project_meltshiny/about.md)** - MeltShiny is a web application that automates the analysis and visualization of DNA melting curves for researchers in chemistry, biology, and genetics.  
  
**[Mouser](project_mouser/about.md)** - Mouser is a desktop app for tracking the data of animal experiments.  

**[Open Project](project_open_project/about.md)** - SLU Open Project is a web-based work management tool that enables shared service providers in universities and similar contexts. It was originally built to support the [SLU Center for Additive Manufacturing (SLU-CAM)](https://www.slu.edu/research/research-institute/big-ideas/slu-cam/index.php), and is expanding to support a variety of use cases.

**[Pilot Data Synchronization](project_pilot_data_synchronization/about.md)** - PDS establishes a real-time data synchronization channel between a flight simulator and the iMotions platform, enabling the accurate capture and analysis of critical flight data to enhance pilot performance evaluation. 

**[Python TBE Library](https://github.com/oss-slu/python_tbe)** - Python TBE is a set of libraries that enables use of TBE files, a format for metadata-enriched tabular data.
  
**[Speech Tagging](project_saltify/about)** - Saltify Speech Tagging software transcribes an audio sample into a written format that is accepted by SALT software.   

**[Step Time Biofeedback](project_step_time_biofeedback/about)** - Step Time Biofeedback is a tool that leverages force signal data from a Bertec split-belt treadmill to calculate step time and project target zones into a biofeedback system.

**[Where's Religion Desktop](project_wheres_religion_desktop/about.md)** - Where's Religion Desktop is a web app for ethnographers of "Lived Religion" that enables detailed reflection and analysis of events captured with the Where's Religion Mobile app.  
  
**[Where's Religion Mobile](project_wheres_religion_mobile/about.md)** - Where's Religion Mobile is a mobile app for ethnographers of "Lived Religion" to capture the events happening around them along with some audio/visual representation of the event.  

## External Partnership Projects & Products

**[Inner Peace Time](project_innerpeacetime/about.md)** - Inner peace time is a guided meditation app developed to help children and families breathe for calm and find their safe place for LOVE and HEALING.

**[Material Donor Mutual Assist](project_MDMA/about.md)** - The Material Donor Mutual Assist project by BWorks simplifies donation management by allowing donors to track their contributions from donation to use, fostering trust and encouraging ongoing support.
