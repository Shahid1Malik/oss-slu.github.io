# Portfolio

Open Source with SLU makes open source software that supports research.

## New Projects, Partnerships, & Products

We are open to new project requests. Learn more on our [software request page](about/software).
We are especially interested in projects supporting researchers, focused on research outcomes, meeting unmet needs.

## Current Open Source with SLU Products

<!-- **Project Name** One-sentence description of the purpose of the project  -->

**[Bubble Scan](project_bubblescan/about.md)** - The bubble scan is a web application where the user provides digital copies of standard paper scantron sheets in a PDF format and the software produces tabular results in a CSV file.

**[DADS (Database of Arithmetic Dynamical Systems)](project_dads/about.md)** - The goal of this project is to create a flexible, web-based, search-driven user interface for a database of arithmetic dynamical systems  
  
**[Digital Bone Box](project_digital_bone_box/about.md)** - This project is a Web Application aims to convert an existing PowerPoint-based educational tool into an interactive, mobile-friendly web application.

**[Drone World](project_droneworld/about.md)** - DroneWorld is a platform for testing small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) applications by simulating realistic test scenarios based on specified requirements.

**[Electronic Structure Parser](./project_esp/about.md)** - The esp is a web application that allows the user to upload the ORCA/Gaussian data and the software produces tabular results in a Word document.

**[Enhancing Bioinformatics Research through LLM](project_enhancing_bioinformatics_research_through_LLM/about.md)** - This project is focused on developing an AI-driven tool that supports bioinformatics research by providing intelligent API recommendations, detecting errors, and offering real-time corrections. The tool leverages large language models trained on bioinformatics codebases to ensure reliable data retrieval and analysis, ultimately improving research accuracy and efficiency.
  
**[MeltShiny](project_meltshiny/about.md)** - automates the analysis and visualization of DNA melting curves for researchers in chemistry, biology, and genetics.  
  
**[Mouser](project_mouser/about.md)** - This software is used for tracking the data of animal experiments.  

**[Pilot Data Synchronization](project_pilot_data_synchronization/about.md)** - This project aims to establish a real-time data synchronization channel between a flight simulator and the iMotions platform, enabling the accurate capture and analysis of critical flight data to enhance pilot performance evaluation. 

**[Python TBE Library](https://github.com/oss-slu/python_tbe)** - Python library that enables use of TBE files, a format for metadata-enriched tabular data.
  
**[Speech Tagging](project_saltify/about)** - This software transcribes an audio sample into a written format that is accepted by SALT software.   

**[Step Time Biofeedback](project_step_time_biofeedback/about)** - This project is focused on developing a tool that leverages force signal data from a Bertec split-belt treadmill to calculate step time and project target zones into a biofeedback system.

**[Where's Religion Desktop](project_wheres_religion_desktop/about.md)** - Where's Religion Desktop is an enhancement on the mobile version which will have extended features.  
  
**[Where's Religion Mobile](project_wheres_religion_mobile/about.md)** - This Project is to create an application for ethnographers to capture the events happening around them along with some audio/visual representation of the event.  

## External Partnership Projects & Products

**[Inner Peace Time](project_innerpeacetime/about.md)** - Inner peace time is a guided meditation app developed to help children and families breathe for calm and find their safe place for LOVE and HEALING.

**[Material Donor Mutual Assist](project_MDMA/about.md)** - The Material Donor Mutual Assist project by BWorks simplifies donation management by allowing donors to track their contributions from donation to use, fostering trust and encouraging ongoing support.

**[Open Energy Dashboard](project_open_energy_dashboard/about.md)** - Open Energy Dashboard is a user-friendly way to display energy information from smart energy meters or uploaded via CSV files.
  
**[Pi4Micronaut](project_pi4micronaut/about.md)** - A Java library crafted for developers who aim to build IoT  applications leveraging the Raspberry Pi platform.

**[Rerum Playground](project_rerum_playground/about.md)** - Rerum Playground project is a webspace with tools to interact with objects that may exist in RERUM and all over the internet.

**[Shelter Volunteers](project_shelter_volunteers/about.md)** - Simplify the process of scheduling work shifts for volunteers, and to give homeless shelters visibility into their upcoming staffing.

**[TPEN Interfaces](project_tpeninterfaces/about.md)** - The TPEN Interfaces project provides a set of customizable web interfaces that leverage the TPEN Services API.
