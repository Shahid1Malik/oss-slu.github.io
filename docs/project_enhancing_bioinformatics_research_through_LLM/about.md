## Overview

This project aims to develop a tool leveraging large language models (LLMs) to recommend bioinformatics APIs and detect API usage errors in research code. The tool will specifically address the challenges of proper API usage in bioinformatics, where incorrect data handling can lead to faulty conclusions and, in severe cases, affect patient outcomes. The LLM will be trained on bioinformatics codebases, ensuring the tool can understand and guide correct API usage. The end goal is to improve research reliability, accelerate discoveries, and enhance data-driven health solutions.
