## Overview

The Digital Bone Box Web App project aims to convert an existing PowerPoint-based educational tool into an interactive, mobile-friendly web application. This app will provide medical students with a comprehensive, easy-to-navigate resource for studying skeletal anatomy. 

The app will categorize the bones into modules such as the bony pelvis, lower limb, upper limb, thorax, skull, and vertebrae. Each module will allow students to explore different bone structures, view detailed information, and interact with labels that identify various parts of the bones.

### Project Vision

- **Transforming an Educational Tool:** Convert the Digital Bone Box, which includes real photos of bones with overlays and detailed descriptions, into a web application.

- **Enhancing Student Learning:** Provide students with an engaging and interactive way to study anatomy compared to traditional methods.

### Existing Tool and Conversion

- **From PowerPoint to Interactive App:** The current Digital Bone Box is a PowerPoint presentation with educational content. This project will transform it into a mobile app that students can easily use on their devices.

- **Features of the Pre-existing Digital Bone Box:** Includes real photos of bones, overlays, and detailed descriptions to aid in the study of human anatomy

### Description

The Digital Bone Box Web App will be developed based on the content from the existing PowerPoint slides, transforming static presentations into a dynamic, user-centric learning tool. Key features of the app will include: 

- **Categorized Bone Modules:**

The app will organize bones into six main categories: Boney Pelvis, Lower Limb, Upper Limb, Thorax, Skull, and Vertebrae. 

Students can easily navigate through these categories to focus on specific areas of study. 

- **Interactive Bone Exploration:**

Upon selecting a bone category, students will access detailed information about individual bones within that group. 

Each bone module will feature high-quality images from the original PowerPoint, enhanced with interactive elements. 

- **Home and Label Functionality:**

Within each bone module, students will have access to "Home" and "Label" buttons. 

The "Home" button will likely return users to the main view of the selected bone. 

The "Label" button will toggle on/off anatomical labels, allowing students to test their knowledge and learn bone structures. 

- **Detailed Descriptions:**

The app will incorporate detailed descriptions from the PowerPoint slides, providing students with comprehensive information about each bone and its features. 

- **Mobile-Optimized Design:**

The web app will be designed with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction on various devices, especially mobile phones and tablets. 

- **User-Friendly Interface:**

The app will feature intuitive navigation and a clean, modern design to enhance the user experience and facilitate effective learning.
