Our goal is to help children and families grow stronger together. We help children and their parents breathe for calm and find their safe place for love and healing with guided meditations and powerful mind-body tools.

### User Guide
The inner peace time meditation app can be downloaded from the website  https://slu.innerpeacetime.com/ Each user has their own login ID and password to access the website. Documentation on how to access the app will be provided. The app has several videos and audio files that have guided meditation. Users can open the files and follow the guided meditation. Our job at Open Source is to maintain the app, test cases if needed and assist the client with their need. Sometimes it can be developing new app features, creating new webpages for exporting data, etc. We do not have complete access to all the tools used for this app. The React and WordPress backend source code is available on GitHub. All video and audio files are stored in Vimeo and can be accessed from WordPress.
