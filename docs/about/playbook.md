# Playbook
## Purpose

## Resources needed

1. Courses that primarily rely on hands-on software development as a teaching mechanism.
2. Tech leads
3. Program director (budget to support program director salary)
4. Computing resources - some projects need more stuff
5. Software project requests
6. Partners - faculty needing software, industry willing to sponsor projects
7. Collaboration tools:
   * GitHub organization account with teacher benefits
   * Slack instance
   * Physical space for meetings and co-development

#### Overview

In a course that primarily relies on software development projects as a teaching mechanisms, students enrolled in the course act as primary developers for selected projects. In our case, student developers came from the Computer Science capstone course - a two semester sequence, with 2 credit hours per semester.

At the start of the semester, students were presented with project options, and were asked to rank order all projects based on their interest and preferences. The course instructor used these rank orders to form teams. This turned into a multi-objective optimization problem with objectives being: 1) keep team size betwen 2 and 4 people, 2) maximize students' project interest, and 3) balance overall team skill level. While objectives 1 and 2 can be programmed, objective 3 is a subjective and relies heavily on instructor's familiarity with students' skills. In our case, the team formation was done manually. In the future, this process can be improved by programmatically assignming students to teams based on the identified objectives. Once tentative teams were formed, all students interviewed with project-specific tech leads. This served several purposes. Firstly, enrolled students practiced their interviewing skills, tech leads met members of their team and were able to voice concerns they had, and tech leads practiced being an interviewer. Interview feedback allowed the instructor to make team adjustments, if necessary.

Prior to the start of the project, tech leads were asked to create GitHub issues, describing various development tasks that needed to be completed. Once teams were formed, the software development commenced. The work was divided into 2-week sprints. During each sprint, each developer was responsible for resolving one issue in their GitHub repository. We utilized "trunk based" development, to keep the process simple and manageable for the studetns. Each student created a branch from the main branch of their project repo and worked on their selected issue in that branch, pushing their branch to the remote repo occasionally. At the end of week 1, each student was required to submit a draft pull request, demonstrating their progress. At the end of week 2, the work in progress pull request was to be converted to a pull request. The tech lead and other teammates reviewed the pull request, providing comments and requesting changes, if needed. Once all comments were addressed, the tech lead merged the pull request to the main branch. In order to earn credit for week 2, the student's pull request had to be merged to main by the deadline.
