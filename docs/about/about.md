Open Source with SLU was established to help SLU researchers with their custom software needs, and to give students practical software development experience. The program is funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and employs Computer Science graduate students to prototype, design, and deliver open-source software to help SLU researchers and their collaborators worldwide. Undergraduate students enrolled in project-based courses work with Open Source with SLU under the mentorship of our graduate students to contribute to ongoing open source projects.

### Kate Holdener, Ph.D.

Kate Holdener is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Saint Louis University. Her main focus in the department is on software engineering courses. She founded the open-source software program in an effort to engage more students in open-source development, as a way to give them practical experience during school.

## Graduate Students

Graduate students are at the heart of our open-sourâ€‹ce program. They work with SLU researchers to understand their software needs, iterate on software prototypes, and deliver proof of concept solutions. Graduate students lead and mentor our undergraduate open-source developers.

## SLU Research Team Leads

Staff from Saint Louis University's Research Computing Group have been key partners, and have even taken on the responsibility of leading teams of undergraduate students. Their work includes active open-source projects being used in academia and research. Projects involve SLU researchers across campus, regional organizations such as the Taylor Geospatial Institute, Washington University in Saint Louis, Newberry Library, the Jesuit Archives, Missouri Botanical Garden, and the St. Louis Federal Reserve. They are also involved in international open standards groups such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This team supports the popular public tools TPEN ([t-pen.org](https://t-pen.org)) and the Rerum ecosystem ([rerum.io](https://rerum.io)).

### Patrick Cuba

Patrick Cuba is the IT Architect for RCG at SLU. His service is focused on consulting and project development, translating research questions into features, and helping to accelerate human-driven research. Specifically, he designs, develops, and implements technological solutions for use cases that escape typical vendor solutions, usually because of requirements for sustainability, openness, or customizable encoding. He has a passion for the record of human knowledge, especially supporting controversy, ambiguity, and attribution.

### Bryan Haberberger

Bryan Haberberger is the Full Stack Developer for RCG at SLU. He works in the technology stacks behind various projects, and his focus shifts sprint by sprint. Simply put, he is a professional developer on campus and a resource for faculty, staff, students, and outside collaborators looking for software development expertise, especially in the realm of Web Applications. In recent years, he has accrued specialized skills with geospatial data on the web and is a member of the Open Geospatial Consortium, as well as an IIIF Maps TSG co-chair, as part of his commitment to open-source technologies.
