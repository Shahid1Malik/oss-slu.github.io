Submit your software request using **[this form](https://forms.gle/HiDUCSLPwM9EJxzX7).**

We will use your form resonses to evaluate if your request is a good fit for us. The requirements below describe our project selection process.

### Minimum Requirements 

These questions must have a yes answer for the project to be selected (either to the main question or the sub-question).

1. Will this project involve software development?
1. Can students develop this software without needing access to specialized equipment? If no:
   1. Will the client provide remote access to the necessary equipment dedicated to our student team? (Equipment is considered dedicated to our student team if our student team can use the equipment either exclusively or the equipment can be used simultaneously by multiple users). If no,
   1. Is the necessary equipment available to be placed in the Open Source with SLU lab space?
1. Does the client agree to keep the source code in a public GitHub repository? If no:
   1. Will the client pay for the software development efforts?
1. Does this project have clear and achievable work objectives?

### Additional Factors

These questions will be used to rank submitted project requests.

1. Is this software necessary for a grant funded project? If no:
   1. Will having this software help the client apply for a grant in the next year?
1. Will building this software help Open Source with SLU establish an industry partnership?
1. Will building this software help promote Open Source with SLU within the St. Louis region?
1. Will this project involve contributing to an existing open-source software (package/library) with a significant user base? If no:
   1. Is this a project to replace a legacy tool that can no longer be supported/modified/maintained?
   1. Will this project transform timely manual work into a software solution?
1. Will this project involve using programming languages our students are familiar with (python/java/c++)?
1. Is this software necessary to achieve a specific research outcome that is not achievable with existing software solutions?
1. Are there any students interested in working on this project?
