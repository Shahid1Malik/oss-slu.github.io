## Overview

The Gallery of Glosses is a combination of interfaces that allow non-technical users to perform research and classify Glosses (on-page commentary) from the Gospel of Matthew and other source manuscripts. There is a NextJS interface for the public-facing website bootstrapped with style. This interface can be use by anyone to view infromation ragrading glosse and manuscripts. There is another interface build in React JS which is used by researchers and administration for adding and editing gloss and manuscript information. The data for these interfaces comes from Rerum.
