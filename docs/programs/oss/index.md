This program is connecting students with real-world open source development while building tomorrow's tech workforce.

## Transforming Students Into Professional Developers

Opening Skills and Solutions bridges the gap between academic learning and professional software development. We connect motivated students with meaningful open source projects and real client needs, providing hands-on experience that transforms classroom knowledge into industry-ready skills.

## Real Projects, Real Impact

This isn't simulation or classroom exercises. Our students work as professional developers on projects that matter:

### Client-Driven Development

Students build software that solves actual problems for real organizations, with clients who depend on the results and drive project priorities.

### Open Source Contributions

Code goes into production systems used by thousands of developers worldwide, creating lasting impact and public portfolios.

### Professional Standards

Industry-standard workflows, code review processes, and quality expectations prepare students for immediate workplace success.
