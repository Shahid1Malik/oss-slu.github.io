*From client needs to deployed solutions: our proven development process*

## Client-Driven Development Process

Opening Skills and Solutions operates on a simple but powerful principle: real software development requires real clients with real needs. Our process ensures students work on projects that matter while clients receive quality solutions.

<!-- ![Process flow diagram: client request → team formation → development cycles → deployment]() -->

### Client Engagement

Organizations bring us specific software challenges—internal tools, data analysis platforms, community websites, or research applications. We work with clients to:

- **Define clear requirements** and success criteria
- **Establish project scope** appropriate for student teams
- **Set realistic timelines** that balance learning with delivery
- **Maintain ongoing communication** throughout development

### Project Scoping

Not every software request becomes a student project. We carefully evaluate potential projects to ensure they:

- Provide meaningful learning opportunities for developers
- Can be completed within academic timelines
- Have engaged clients who can provide feedback and guidance
- Align with our open source mission and values

## Development Methodology

### Semester-Long Iterations

Student teams work on open source products in semester-long iterations inspired by Extreme Programming principles. Teams typically continue working on the same product across multiple semesters, building sustained engagement and deeper expertise.

**Weekly Development Rhythm:**

- **Team meetings** for planning, code review, and problem-solving
- **Client collaboration** to demonstrate progress and gather feedback
- **Continuous development** with ongoing testing and quality assurance
- **Faculty and Tech Lead support** for technical guidance and mentorship

### Between-Iteration Planning

Tech Leads work with clients during semester breaks to prepare for upcoming iterations:

- Client discovery and requirements gathering
- Architecture and development planning
- Technology stack evaluation when needed
- Team preparation and goal setting

### Dual-Purpose Handoffs

Each iteration concludes with handoffs serving two audiences:

- **Client handoff** of new features and improvements
- **Team handoff** to ensure continuity for future development

**Student Showcases:**

- **Fall semester**: Live pitch presentations highlighting product vision and recent work
- **Spring semester**: Poster presentations as part of the School of Science and Engineering showcase

## Continuous Learning Integration

### Academic Alignment

Every project serves dual purposes: delivering client value while maximizing student learning opportunities.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Professional software development practices
- Collaborative coding and version control
- Client communication and requirement analysis
- Project management and deadline management
- Technical problem-solving and debugging

### Skill Development Tracking

Students and faculty monitor progress across both technical and professional competencies, ensuring comprehensive career preparation.

## Success Metrics

We measure success through multiple lenses:

**Client Satisfaction:**

- Delivered software meets or exceeds requirements
- Projects completed on schedule and within scope
- Ongoing use and value of delivered solutions

**Student Development:**

- Technical skill advancement and portfolio building
- Professional readiness and career placement
- Confidence in real-world development scenarios

**Community Impact:**

- Open source contributions and community engagement
- Knowledge sharing and documentation quality
- Long-term project sustainability and maintenance
