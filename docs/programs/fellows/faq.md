### Program Logistics

**Q: How much time commitment is required?**
A: Fellows typically invest 4-8 hours per month, including 2 in-person events per semester and regular online engagement with student teams. The exact time varies based on your availability and the needs of your matched teams.

**Q: Can I participate if I'm not local to St. Louis?**
A: While we prioritize local candidates who can attend in-person events, we consider remote candidates. Remote candidates who can commit to traveling to campus for required events are considered equally with local candidates.

**Q: What if I've never mentored before?**
A: No prior mentoring experience is required. Our training program provides skills and techniques for mentorship relationships.

**Q: How are Fellows matched with student teams?**
A: We match based on technical expertise, project requirements, industry experience, and mutual interests to create good mentoring relationships.

**Q: When does the program start and how long does it last?**
A: The program runs on the academic calendar with new cohorts starting each fall and spring semester. Fellows can participate for one semester or multiple semesters based on their availability and interest.

**Q: What happens if I need to step back mid-semester?**
A: We understand that professional and personal circumstances change. We ask for as much notice as possible and work to ensure students have continued support through other Fellows or program staff.

**Q: Are there age or experience requirements?**
A: We require a minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience, but there are no age restrictions. We welcome applicants at all career stages who are interested in mentoring.

### Technical Requirements

**Q: Do I need expertise in specific technologies?**
A: We welcome Fellows with diverse technical backgrounds. Current student projects span a range of established and emerging technologies. Technical expertise that overlaps with existing projects is valuable, but not required.

**Q: What if my skills don't match current student projects?**
A: Mentorship extends beyond technical skills to include career guidance, professional development, and industry insights that benefit all students.

**Q: Can I contribute to curriculum development?**
A: Yes! Fellows are encouraged to provide input on curriculum, suggest project ideas, and contribute to program improvements based on industry trends.

**Q: What types of projects do students work on?**
A: Student projects include web services, mobile apps, desktop software, developer libraries, upstream open source contributions, and research initiatives. Projects are typically sponsored by researchers on campus, community groups, or other external organizations. All our projects address real-world problems.

**Q: Do I need to know the specific technologies students are using?**
A: Not necessarily. While technical overlap is helpful, much of the mentoring focuses on software development practices, architecture decisions, and professional skills that transcend specific technologies. That said, students are exposed to a range of technologies as part of their education, and technologies currently in use include Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, C++, Java, R, and others.

### Professional Development

**Q: What training is provided?**
A: Fellows receive training in mentorship techniques, communication strategies, and student development approaches. Training is offered each semester through workshops and online materials, and can be repeated. Fellows can also get individual support as needed.

**Q: How does this benefit my career?**
A: Fellows develop leadership skills, expand professional networks, gain fresh perspectives from students, and contribute to industry talent development.

**Q: Are there opportunities for recognition?**
A: Fellows receive certificates, LinkedIn recognition, program endorsements, and opportunities to present at conferences and industry events.

**Q: Can I use this experience on my resume?**
A: Absolutely. Industry Fellow experience demonstrates leadership, mentoring skills, and commitment to professional development. We provide documentation of your participation and contributions.

**Q: Will I meet other industry professionals?**
A: Yes. The program creates networking opportunities with other Fellows, university faculty, and industry partners through events, training sessions, and social gatherings.

### Student Interaction

**Q: How many students will I mentor?**
A: Typically, Fellows work with 1-3 students or one small team, depending on your availability and the needs of current projects.

**Q: What's the difference between mentoring graduate and undergraduate students?**
A: Graduate students (Tech Leads) receive mentoring focused on leadership, project management, and technical architecture. Undergraduate students receive guidance on technical skills, professional development, and career preparation.

**Q: How often do I interact with students?**
A: Interaction frequency varies but typically includes weekly or bi-weekly check-ins, code reviews as needed, and participation in the required semester events.

**Q: What if I don't connect well with my matched student(s)?**
A: We monitor mentoring relationships and can facilitate conversations or re-matching if needed. Good fit is important for both Fellows and students.

**Q: Can I stay in touch with students after they graduate?**
A: Many Fellows maintain professional relationships with former mentees. We encourage networking and ongoing professional connections.

### Practical Questions

**Q: Where do the in-person events take place?**
A: Events are held on the Saint Louis University campus, typically in the Computer Science Department or nearby facilities.

**Q: What if I can't attend one of the required events?**
A: We understand scheduling conflicts happen. We ask for advance notice when possible and may arrange alternative ways to fulfill requirements.

**Q: How do I access campus facilities?**
A: Fellows receive university ID cards that provide access to libraries, co-working spaces, and other campus facilities during business hours.

**Q: Is there parking available for campus events?**
A: Yes, we provide information about parking options and any necessary permits for Fellows attending campus events.

**Q: What technology platforms do you use for online mentoring?**
A: We use common platforms like Slack, Zoom, and GitHub, but we're flexible based on Fellow and student preferences.

### Application Process

**Q: How competitive is the application process?**
A: We aim to accept qualified candidates who demonstrate technical expertise, mentoring interest, and program alignment. Since this is a new program, we're building our initial cohort of Fellows.

**Q: How long does the application process take?**
A: From application submission to notification typically takes 3-4 weeks, depending on the timing and completeness of your application.

**Q: What if I'm not selected this round?**
A: We encourage reapplication in future semesters. We provide feedback when possible and welcome candidates to strengthen their applications over time.

**Q: Can I apply for a specific semester?**
A: Yes, you can indicate your preferred start semester in the application. We try to accommodate timing preferences when possible.

### Program Support

**Q: Who can I contact if I have questions during the program?**
A: Program staff are available for support throughout your participation. We provide contact information during onboarding and maintain regular communication channels.

**Q: What if I want to suggest improvements to the program?**
A: We welcome feedback and suggestions! Fellows contribute to program development through regular feedback sessions and informal input.

**Q: Is there a Fellow community or network?**
A: Yes, we facilitate connections among Fellows through training sessions, social events, and online communication channels.
