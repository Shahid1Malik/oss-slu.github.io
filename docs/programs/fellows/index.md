Our Industry Fellows Program bridges the gap between academic learning and professional practice by pairing seasoned industry professionals with student development teams. Fellows work primarily with graduate students who serve as Tech Leads for capstone projects, while also providing guidance to undergraduate students enrolled in our CS capstone course.

## What makes this program unique:

- **Official University Affiliation:** Fellows receive university ID cards, email access, library privileges, and co-working space access on campus
- **Specialized Training:** Mentorship training helps both mentors and students get more value from their collaboration
- **Structured Commitment:** Clear expectations and regular touchpoints create consistency and accountability
- **Sustained Relationships:** Multi-semester partnerships allow for deep, ongoing professional development
- **Mutual Benefit:** Fellows gain fresh perspectives, networking opportunities, and the satisfaction of shaping future developers

## Program Structure

The Industry Fellows Program operates on a structured academic calendar designed to support students during key periods of their development. Each fall semester begins with onboarding and training in August, followed by team matching in September that pairs Fellows with graduate Tech Leads and undergraduate capstone teams based on technical expertise and project needs. Throughout the fall, Fellows provide mentorship in technical leadership, architecture decisions, code review practices, and project management through regular online engagement and required on-site events. The spring semester focuses on final project phases as students begin job searching, with Fellows offering career guidance, industry insights, and professional networking opportunities during February and March. The program concludes each spring with student showcase presentations in April and Fellow recognition events in May.

Graduate students serving as Tech Leads receive focused mentorship in developing their leadership capabilities, technical decision-making skills, and professional communication as they guide their undergraduate team members. Undergraduate capstone students gain industry exposure, real-world perspectives on software development practices, career development guidance, and networking connections that support their transition from academic learning to professional practice.
