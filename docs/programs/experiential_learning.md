Think about riding a bike—you can read about balance, memorize gear ratios, and study physics, but until you get on and pedal, you're not really learning to ride. The same principle applies when preparing for professional software development careers. Experiential learning bridges classroom theory with real-world practice by engaging students in authentic projects that mirror professional environments. Our three programs create different pathways for students to gain hands-on experience while contributing meaningful value to research, community, and industry partners.

## Programs

### Opening Skills and Solutions (OSS Program)

Our flagship program connects students as developers with real-world software development projects while preparing workforce-ready graduates. Product teams follow rigorous open source software engineering disciplines through capstone teams, near-peer leadership, sponsored developers, and faculty support, creating lasting impact for clients and the broader research community.

### Building Open Leadership Toolsets (BOLT)

BOLT is an intensive workshop designed to equip participants with essential skills and knowledge needed to lead open source software projects, particularly in research contexts. Offered strategically every summer and winter before classes begin, BOLT ensures that new graduate student Tech Leads are fully prepared to guide their teams from day one.

### Open Source in Service

Our commitment to community engagement demonstrates how open source principles can amplify social and community impact through experiential learning programs that bridge technology and social impact, pairing computer science students working as developers with local non-profit partners and research labs.
