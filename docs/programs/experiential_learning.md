## Experiential Learning

Our flagship initiative is our experiential learning program. We provides students practical experience developing software products and platforms for our clients using successful software development practices from industry.

## Flagship Program <!-- Needs a better title-->

To do this we use leading practices from industry to assemble a team around each product or major feature we build. Most of these clients are SLU researchers and their collaborators worldwide. Computer Science graduate students serve as Tech Leads for a product team of software developers. CS undergraduate students enrolled in project-based courses work with Open Source with SLU and guided by our graduate students to contribute to ongoing open source projects.

### Client-Driven Software Development

### Capstone Teams

### Near-Peer Leadership

## Building Open Leadership Toolsets (BOLT)

BOLT is a workshop that gives participants the tools required to lead open source software, especially for research. The BOLT workshop is offered every summer and winter immediately before the start of classes to enable new graduate student Tech Leads to be ready to lead their teams as soon as the other developers are identified.
