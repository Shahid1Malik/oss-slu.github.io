Open Source with SLU is the open source program office of Saint Louis University (SLU). It was established to help SLU researchers with custom software needs, give students practical software development experience, and champion open source software practices. The program is funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. 

## Experiential Learning

Our flagship initiative is our experiential learning program. We provides students practical experience developing software products and platforms for our clients using successful software developent practices from industry.

To do this we use leading practices from industry to assemble a team around each product or major feature we build. Most of these clients are SLU researchers and their collaborators worldwide. Computer Science graduate students serve as Tech Leads for a product team of software developers. CS undergraduate students enrolled in project-based courses work with Open Source with SLU and guided by our graduate students to contribute to ongoing open source projects.

## Consulting Services

Open source software and open science are complex and evolving subjects. We offer free consulting service within Saint Louis University so researchers can effectively navigate these domains to secure funding, enable discovery, and increase the impact of research.

## Advocacy for Open

We work on open source software and open science because we know the incredible value it provides. We champion "open" across our university and in our wider community so that more people can understand and benefit from this value. [Find out more about our advocacy programs. ==>](consulting.md)
