Open Source with SLU is the open source program office of Saint Louis University, connecting students with real-world software development projects while advancing open science and helping researchers adopt open source practices to secure funding and increase research impact. This approach to experiential learning creates a pipeline of workforce-ready talent that enables us to partner with industry and community groups as well as academics. As a values-driven university, SLU is uniquely positioned to create meaningful opportunities for students, industry, and the ideas that change both.

## Experiential Learning
Our experiential learning initiative connects students as developers with real-world software challenges while preparing workforce-ready graduates. Through hands-on projects with clients—often SLU researchers and their global collaborators—students develop open source solutions that benefit the broader academic and research community. Students graduate with portfolios of real production software, industry-standard development practices, and proven ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams.
