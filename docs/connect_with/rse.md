## Accelerate Your Research with Custom Software Solutions

Principal Investigators and research labs often encounter unique computational challenges that require specialized software solutions. Open Source with SLU provides expert consultations to help you navigate these challenges, from initial concept through implementation and maintenance.

## Our Consultation Services

### Technical Assessment and Planning

We work with your research team to understand your specific computational needs, evaluate existing tools and workflows, and develop comprehensive software development plans. Our consultants help identify whether your project requires custom development, integration of existing tools, or adaptation of open-source solutions.

### Architecture and Design Guidance

Our experienced developers provide architectural guidance for complex research software projects, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and alignment with research objectives. We help design systems that can grow with your research and integrate seamlessly with existing laboratory workflows.

### Technology Stack Recommendations

Navigate the complex landscape of programming languages, frameworks, and platforms with expert guidance tailored to your research domain. We consider factors including team expertise, long-term maintenance requirements, collaboration needs, and integration with existing research infrastructure.

### Open Source Strategy Development

Maximize the impact and sustainability of your research software through strategic open source planning. We help develop licensing strategies, community engagement plans, and documentation frameworks that support both immediate research goals and long-term software sustainability.

## Who We Serve

### Principal Investigators

PIs benefit from strategic guidance on software development planning, resource allocation, and team building for computational research projects. Our consultations help secure funding by providing realistic project scopes and technical specifications for grant applications.

### Research Labs

Laboratory teams receive hands-on technical guidance for implementing software solutions, training on best practices for collaborative development, and ongoing support for maintaining and extending research software tools.

### Interdisciplinary Research Teams

Complex research projects spanning multiple disciplines often require specialized integration approaches. We help bridge technical gaps between different research domains and establish workflows that support collaborative development.

## Getting Started
