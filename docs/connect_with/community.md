### Getting Started Contributing Code

The success of our projects depends on active involvement. All of our work is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues). Check out the list of existing Issues on one of the project at [https://github.com/oss-slu](https://github.com/oss-slu). Get involved by opening a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) . The PR will be merged when the Pull Request includes a link to a merged ticket from a project in the [portfolio](/projects/portfolio) that they made contribution to, and the PR has been approved by the current tech lead on that project.

You can get started in a jiffy:

* Join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/oswslu/shared_invite/zt-24f0qhjbo-NkSfQ4LOg5wXxBdxP4vzfA).
* Identify an [Open Source with SLU project](/projects/portfolio).
* Find an Issue in the project repo that looks doable
* Fork the project repository, and make a branch
* You are on your way, just stay in touch to keep your work moving forward.

#### Tools

If you are making changes to code you're going to need a variety of tools. On your computer your going to need a variety of local tools to create your local development environment. You will probably want to set up an [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) on your workstation. There are lots of options available, and it can be a very personal choice. Many people in our community use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for their IDE. You might want to check with the current members of the project team for their suggestions.

You will also need to know the basics about Git and GitHub. We recommend this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk) from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org), if you are not familiar with these tools.

#### GitHub

All our projects are stored in public GitHub repositories. To make code contributions to our repositories, you will need to know the basics of GitHub. [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en)

#### Git

GitHub is a platform that has git at the core. All changes to our project source code are stored using git To make code contributions to our repositories. [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)

## Join the OSS Organization

Active contributors who make five or more contributions can join [the oss-slu GitHub organization](https://github.com/oss-slu), gaining enhanced collaboration access and formal recognition of their involvement. Organization members enjoy streamlined code review processes, direct access to project repositories, and deeper integration with development teams.

To request membership, send a Slack message to the current Tech Lead of your project(s) with links to at least five resolved issues or merged pull requests. Applications are typically reviewed within two weeks, during the academic year. If you reach out during summer or winter breaks, it may take us a little longer to respond. Once approved, you'll gain write access to repositories and can take on greater responsibility in project development and community leadership.
