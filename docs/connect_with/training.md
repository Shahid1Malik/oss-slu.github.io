## Hands-On Learning for Research Computing

Open Source with SLU offers interactive clinics and workshops designed to build practical skills in research computing, software development, and open science practices. These sessions provide hands-on experience with tools and techniques essential for modern computational research.

## Workshop Series

### Git and GitHub for Researchers

Learn version control fundamentals specifically tailored for research workflows. Participants gain experience with collaborative coding, managing research data versions, and using GitHub for project organization and sharing. This workshop covers branching strategies for experimental work, handling large datasets, and integrating version control with common research tools.

### Python for Data Analysis

Develop proficiency in Python libraries essential for research computing, including pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and Jupyter notebooks. Workshops progress from basic data manipulation to advanced analysis techniques, with examples drawn from various research domains including life sciences, social sciences, and engineering.

### R Programming for Statistical Analysis

Build expertise in R for statistical computing and graphics, covering data import/export, statistical modeling, and publication-quality visualization. Sessions include hands-on practice with real research datasets and guidance on reproducible analysis workflows using R Markdown and related tools.

### Web Scraping and API Integration

Learn to collect data from web sources using ethical scraping techniques and API integration. Workshops cover legal and ethical considerations, rate limiting, data cleaning, and integration with research databases. Participants work with real-world examples relevant to their research domains.

### Machine Learning for Research Applications

Explore machine learning techniques applied to research problems, covering supervised and unsupervised learning, model validation, and interpretation of results. Sessions focus on practical implementation using popular libraries and frameworks, with emphasis on understanding when and how to apply different approaches.

### Database Design for Research Data

Develop skills in designing and implementing databases for research data management, covering relational database concepts, SQL fundamentals, and integration with analysis tools. Workshops include hands-on practice with database design, querying, and connecting databases to analysis environments.

## Clinic Format

### Drop-In Technical Support

Weekly drop-in sessions provide one-on-one technical support for ongoing research computing challenges. Bring your code, data, or technical questions for personalized assistance from experienced developers and researchers.

### Lab-Specific Training

Customized training sessions designed for individual research labs, focusing on tools and techniques most relevant to specific research domains. These sessions can be scheduled to accommodate lab meeting times and research schedules.

### Collaborative Problem-Solving

Group sessions where participants work together on common research computing challenges, fostering peer learning and knowledge sharing across different research domains and experience levels.

## Who Should Attend
