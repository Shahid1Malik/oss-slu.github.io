As part of Saint Louis University's mission to foster learning, advance knowledge through research, and serve others, we seek partnerships that create meaningful impact beyond traditional academic boundaries. We're particularly interested in collaborations that foster transformative learning experiences, build shared digital infrastructure that benefits entire communities, and develop workforce capabilities that prepare people for tomorrow's opportunities. Through these partnerships, we aim to shape a better future for all by democratizing access to technology skills and creating pathways for inclusive economic growth.

Our ideal partnerships combine technical innovation with social purpose, whether that's developing open source solutions for nonprofit organizations, creating educational pathways for underrepresented communities in technology, or building research tools and digital infrastructure that accelerate discovery across disciplines. We believe that the most transformative work happens when academic expertise meets community needs, guided by values of transparency, collaboration, and inclusive excellence that define both open source culture and Jesuit education.

Let's innovate together toward a future where technology serves humanity's highest aspirations, where knowledge flows freely to benefit all, and where partnerships create lasting positive change that empowers individuals, strengthens communities, and builds the foundation for shared prosperity.
