## Overview

The objective of this project is to create an educational learning tool enabling teachers to showcase the pronunciation of Spanish words. Students can use this application to practice pronunciation. Students can observe their improvement through a compilation of spectrograms that compare their pronunciations with native speakers' pronunciations.
