### Current Tech Leads

Tech Leads staffed by graduate students with proven track records of successs are key to our experiential learning program. By working closely with SLU researchers to understand their needs, iterate on prototypes, and deliver solutions they ensure successful outcomes. By leading and mentoring our undergraduate open-source developers they develop both software as well as talented software engineers.
