## Student Developers

### Current Tech Leads

Tech Leads staffed by graduate students with proven track records of successs are key to our experiential learning program. By working closely with SLU researchers to understand their needs, iterate on prototypes, and deliver solutions they ensure successful outcomes. By leading and mentoring our undergraduate open-source developers they develop both software as well as talented software engineers.

## University Partners

We work closely with a range of key staff across a variety of units at Saint Louis University

### Research Computing

Staff from Saint Louis University's Research Computing Group are key partners. They have provided existing open source projects, and have even taken on the responsibility of leading and mentoring teams of student developers. Their work includes active open-source projects being used in academia and research. Projects involve SLU researchers across campus, regional organizations such as the Taylor Geospatial Institute, Washington University in Saint Louis, Newberry Library, the Jesuit Archives, Missouri Botanical Garden, and the St. Louis Federal Reserve. They are also involved in international open standards groups such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This team supports the popular public tools TPEN ([t-pen.org](https://t-pen.org)) and the Rerum ecosystem ([rerum.io](https://rerum.io)).
