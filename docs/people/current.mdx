</div>

Kate Holdener founded Open Source with SLU. She was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Saint Louis University until Spring of 2025. Her main focus in the department was on software engineering courses. She founded the open-source software program in an effort to engage more students in open-source development, as a way to give them practical experience during school. She is still involved in the program as a member of our community of contributors, and provides guidance and input that enables the progam.

### Staff Developers

Staff developers work across all our programs to deliver required software, and provide expert guidance on research software engineering and open science.

## Graduate Students

Graduate students serving as Tech Leads are key to our experiential learning program. By working closely with SLU researchers to understand their needs, iterate on prototypes, and deliver solutions they ensure successful outcomes. By leading and mentoring our undergraduate open-source developers they develop both software as well as talented software engineers.

## University Partners

Staff from Saint Louis University's Research Computing Group are key partners. They have provided existing open source projects, and have even taken on the responsibility of leading and mentoring teams of student developers. Their work includes active open-source projects being used in academia and research. Projects involve SLU researchers across campus, regional organizations such as the Taylor Geospatial Institute, Washington University in Saint Louis, Newberry Library, the Jesuit Archives, Missouri Botanical Garden, and the St. Louis Federal Reserve. They are also involved in international open standards groups such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This team supports the popular public tools TPEN ([t-pen.org](https://t-pen.org)) and the Rerum ecosystem ([rerum.io](https://rerum.io)).

Patrick Cuba is the IT Architect for RCG at SLU. His service is focused on consulting and project development, translating research questions into features, and helping to accelerate human-driven research. Specifically, he designs, develops, and implements technological solutions for use cases that escape typical vendor solutions, usually because of requirements for sustainability, openness, or customizable encoding. He has a passion for the record of human knowledge, especially supporting controversy, ambiguity, and attribution.

### Bryan Haberberger
