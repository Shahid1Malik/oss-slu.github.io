## Overview

The Open Energy Dashboard (OED) is a crucial open-source project that facilitates the visualization of energy information through a web-based application. Its significance lies in promoting collaboration and knowledge-sharing to advance common sustainability goals. Unlike other proprietary dashboards, OED is free, portable, and driven by user needs, embodying principles such as perpetual freedom, shared advancements, and user-centric design. The typical user, ranging from energy managers to sustainability professionals, benefits from its user-friendly interface and diverse functionalities, allowing easy management of energy data without the need for external support.
