## Overview

MeltShiny offers an intuitive graphical interface, eliminating the need for the console and accommodating users of all skill levels. Leveraging MeltR's robust calculations, it provides automated processing of input files and outlier removal from Van't Hoff plots and results tables. This optimizes researchers' workflows, minimizing computer interaction time and maximizing dedicated time for research and analysis.
